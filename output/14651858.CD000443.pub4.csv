Participants tended to be a selected elderly group of stroke survivors with moderate disability.

The primary outcome was available for 16 trials (2359 participants). Overall, the odds ratios (OR) for the outcome of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow‐up (median 6 months; range 3 to 12) was OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.01, moderate‐grade evidence) which equates to five fewer adverse outcomes per 100 patients receiving ESD.

Participants tended to be a selected elderly group of stroke survivors with moderate disability. The ESD group showed reductions in the length of hospital stay equivalent to approximately six days (mean difference (MD) ‐5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3 to ‐8 days; P < 0.0001; moderate‐grade evidence). The primary outcome was available for 16 trials (2359 participants). Overall, the odds ratios (OR) for the outcome of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow‐up (median 6 months; range 3 to 12) was OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.01, moderate‐grade evidence) which equates to five fewer adverse outcomes per 100 patients receiving ESD. The results for death (16 trials; 2116 participants) and death or requiring institutional care (12 trials; 1664 participants) were OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.40, P = 0.81, moderate‐grade evidence) and OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, P = 0.02, moderate‐grade evidence), respectively. Small improvements were also seen in participants' extended activities of daily living scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.25, P = 0.01, low‐grade evidence) and satisfaction with services (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.38, P = 0.02, low‐grade evidence). We saw no clear differences in participants' activities of daily living scores, patients subjective health status or mood, or the subjective health status, mood or satisfaction with services of carers. We found low‐quality evidence that the risk of readmission to hospital was similar in the ESD and conventional care group (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.51, P = 0.59, low‐grade evidence). The evidence for the apparent benefits were weaker at one‐ and five‐year follow‐up. Estimated costs from six individual trials ranged from 23% lower to 15% greater for the ESD group in comparison to usual care.  In a series of pre‐planned analyses, the greatest reductions in death or dependency were seen in the trials evaluating a co‐ordinated ESD team with a suggestion of poorer results in those services without a co‐ordinated team (subgroup interaction at P = 0.06). Stroke patients with mild to moderate disability at baseline showed greater reductions in death or dependency than those with more severe stroke (subgroup interaction at P = 0.04).","Appropriately resourced ESD services with co‐ordinated multidisciplinary team input provided for a selected group of stroke patients can reduce long‐term dependency and admission to institutional care as well as reducing the length of hospital stay. Results are inconclusive for services without co‐ordinated multidisciplinary team input.
