",Calcium and phosphorus supplementation of human milk for preterm infants,"Jane E Harding, Jess Wilson, Julie Brown",Review - Intervention,TRUE,NA,Calcium supplementation compared with no calcium supplementation for preterm infants,preterm hospitalised infants,hospital setting,no supplement,Preterm infants are born with low skeletal stores of calcium and phosphorus.

We found no evidence of a difference between calcium and phosphorus supplementation versus no supplementation for neonatal growth outcomes (weight, length, head circumference) at any time point reported (two, four or six weeks postnatal age). At six weeks postnatal age, supplementation with calcium/phosphorus was associated with a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase concentration (MD ‐56.85 IU/L, 95% CI ‐101.27 to ‐12.43; one randomised controlled trial (RCT); n = 40 infants).

We conclude that evidence is insufficient to determine whether benefit or harm ensues when human milk is supplemented with calcium and/or phosphorus for the hospitalised preterm infant.

We found no evidence of a difference between calcium and phosphorus supplementation versus no supplementation for neonatal growth outcomes (weight, length, head circumference) at any time point reported (two, four or six weeks postnatal age). At six weeks postnatal age, supplementation with calcium/phosphorus was associated with a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase concentration (MD ‐56.85 IU/L, 95% CI ‐101.27 to ‐12.43; one randomised controlled trial (RCT); n = 40 infants). Investigators provided no data on growth at 12 to 18 months, neonatal fractures, feed intolerance, breastfeeding or any of the prespecified childhood outcomes for this review (fractures, growth, neurodevelopmental outcomes).","We identified one small trial including only 40 infants that compared supplementation of human milk with calcium and phosphorus versus no supplementation in hospitalised preterm infants. We judged the evidence to be of low quality and found no evidence of differences between groups for clinically important outcomes including growth and fractures. Although serum alkaline phosphatase concentration was reduced in the group receiving supplementation at six weeks postnatal age, this difference is unlikely to be of clinical significance. We conclude that evidence is insufficient to determine whether benefit or harm ensues when human milk is supplemented with calcium and/or phosphorus for the hospitalised preterm infant. We see no advantage of conducting further trials of this intervention because with the advent of multi‐component human milk fortifier, supplementation of human milk with calcium and/or phosphorus alone is no longer common practice. Future trials should consider assessing effects of multi‐component fortifiers with different mineral compositions on clinically important outcomes during the neonatal period and in later childhood.",1,TRUE,FALSE,7,Fracture (childhood/adulthood) ‐ not measured,‐,‐,‐,Included study provided no follow‐up into childhood,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO warnings
