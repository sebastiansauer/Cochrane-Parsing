",Interventions to facilitate shared decision making to address antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in primary care ,"Peter Coxeter, Chris B Del Mar, Leanne McGregor, Elaine M Beller, Tammy C Hoffmann",Review - Intervention,TRUE,NA,Shared decision making compared to usual care for acute respiratory infections in primary care,antibiotic use in acute respiratory infections,primary care,usual care," Shared decision making is an important component of patient‐centred care. It is a set of communication and evidence‐based practice skills that elicits patients' expectations, clarifies any misperceptions and discusses the best available evidence for benefits and harms of treatment. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the most common reasons for consulting in primary care and obtaining prescriptions for antibiotics. However, antibiotics offer few benefits for ARIs, and their excessive use contributes to antibiotic resistance – an evolving public health crisis. Greater explicit consideration of the benefit‐harm trade‐off within shared decision making may reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in primary care.
