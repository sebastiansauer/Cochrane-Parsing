It has been reported that 64% of infants have an episode of AOM by the age of six months and 86% by one year. Although most cases of AOM are due to bacterial infection, it is commonly triggered by a viral infection. In most children AOM is self limiting, but it does carry a risk of complications.

Four trials reported adequate allocation concealment, and 10 trials reported adequate blinding of participants and personnel. Attrition was low for eight trials included in the analysis.  The primary outcome showed a small reduction in at least one episode of AOM over at least six months of follow‐up (4 trials, 3134 children; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.08 to ‐0.00; NNTB 25, 95% CI 12.5 to 100; low‐quality evidence).
