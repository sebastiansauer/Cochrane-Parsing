It can also be caused by a fall or twist. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied; most commonly, supination of the forearm, often combined with flexion, and (hyper‐)pronation. It is unclear which is most successful.

Four trials were conducted in the USA, three in Turkey, one in Iran, and one in Spain. Five trials were at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Eight trials compared hyperpronation with supination‐flexion. We found low‐quality evidence that hyperpronation resulted in less failure at first attempt than supination‐flexion (9.2% versus 26.4%, risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.50; 811 participants, 8 studies).

The very low‐quality evidence (from four studies) for pain during or after manipulation means that it is uncertain whether there is or is not a difference between pronation and supination‐flexion.

Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment.","Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled data using a fixed‐effect model.","Overall, nine trials with 906 children (all younger than seven years old and 58% of whom were female) were included, of which five trials were newly identified in this update. Eight trials were performed in emergency departments or ambulatory care centres, and one was performed in a tertiary paediatric orthopaedic unit. Four trials were conducted in the USA, three in Turkey, one in Iran, and one in Spain. Five trials were at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Eight trials compared hyperpronation with supination‐flexion. We found low‐quality evidence that hyperpronation resulted in less failure at first attempt than supination‐flexion (9.2% versus 26.4%, risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.50; 811 participants, 8 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of 268 failures at first attempt per 1000 children treated using supination‐flexion, this amounted to 174 fewer failures per 1000 children treated using hyperpronation (95% CI 134 to 201 fewer). Based on risk differences data, we also estimated a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI 5 to 8); this means that six children would need to be treated with the hyperpronation method rather than the supination‐flexion method to avoid one additional failure at the first attempt.  The very low‐quality evidence (from four studies) for pain during or after manipulation means that it is uncertain whether there is or is not a difference between pronation and supination‐flexion. There was very low‐quality evidence from six studies that repeat pronation may be more effective than repeat supination‐flexion for the second attempt after initial failure. The remaining outcomes were either not reported (adverse effects, recurrence) or unsuitable for pooling (ultimate failure). Ultimate failure, reported for the overall population only because of the differences in the study protocols with respect to what to do after the first attempt failed, ranged from no ultimate failures in two studies to six failures (4.1% of 148 episodes) in one study.  One trial compared supination‐extension versus supination‐flexion. It provided very low‐quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision) of no clear difference in failure at first attempt between the two methods.","There was low‐quality evidence from eight small trials that the pronation method may be more effective at first attempt than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. For other outcomes, no conclusions could be drawn either because of very low‐quality evidence or the outcomes not being reported. We suggest that a high‐quality randomised clinical trial comparing hyperpronation and supination‐flexion is required to provide definitive evidence. We recommend that this is preceded by a survey among clinicians to establish the extent of clinical equipoise and to optimise the study design and recruitment.",1,TRUE,FALSE,6,Recurrence (within one month),,,,None of the trials reported this outcome.,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO warnings
